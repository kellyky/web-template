A simple website.

## Technologies Used

## Description
This website allows the user to click through a beach walk. 

## Setup
No setup. Just visit the following page and enjoy the sites: https://kellyky.github.io/website-beach-story/

## Known Bugs
I would like to add the ability at the end to restart the walk or close the tab. Perhaps multiple paths - choose your own adventure style. 

There are inconsistent tabs in the HTML - it works but needs cleanup.

## License
TBD.
