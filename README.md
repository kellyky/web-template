# web-template
This is a template for a simple webpage. 

It contains the following:
* index.html with skeleton html, including links to CSS, bootstrap file, and javascript/jquery script tags
* js directory with scripts.js and jquery-3.5.1.js files
* css directory with styles.css and bootstrap.css files
* img directory (empty)

## Technologies Used
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* JQuery
* Bash

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Rename the directory
3. Use as the starter files/directories for your web project

## Updates from This Process
I've since created a shell script that automates most of this (it just depends on having bootstrap/jquery files in a local directory - like this one - to copy over). See [mkweb](https://github.com/kellyky/mkweb) for that. 

## Issues
I don't think the (empty) img directory made it from my system here to GitHub. 

Relies on specific bootstrap/jquery versions. These files may need to be updated.
